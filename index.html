            <li>
              All matches will be 3/5. Meaning first person too get 3 wins in a set wins
            </li>
            <li>
              Copying the opponent's team is against the rules. (2/3 characters)
            </li>
            <li>
              If you disconnect, your game bugs, or is impaired for any other reason after 2 turns then your opponent wins unless you both consent to a rematch. (PLEASE PROVIDE SCREENSHOTS)
            </li>
            <li>
              You may only use the same team once in a set, and cant use the same 2/3 characters again in one set
            </li>
            <li>
              No full chakra drain, counter/reflect, stun, AoE (Offensive), or healing teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Young Kakashi/Hanabi count as stunners. Itachi Body double & Karin is counted as Aoe & Sage Naruto is counted as a counter/Stun/Aoe/healing. Example of a banned team - Shikamaru, Sakura & Kushina as there is 3 people who can stun. Sage Naruto, Kakashi, Yondaime Kakashi would also be banned as 3 characters can counter/reflect. Only 2 max can be used of anything.
              A suitable example team would be Rin, Ten ten, Sakura (only 2 healers, 1 aoe, 1 stun)
            </li>
            <li>
              If an opponent uses a banned character or banned team, the match is voided, and you rematch. However if it happens again the person automatically loses the match. (PLEASE PROVIDE SCREENSHOTS)
            </li>
            <li>
              Any characters released after the start of this tournament is banned.
